# Simple App to read and show hierarcy

This demo has NodeJS and C++ version. The C++ version is not as complete as the NodeJS one. I included C++ because I already wrote it before starting the NodeJS version.

Each version has its own README.md in their own folder. Please read them for description on my approach and how to build/test the demo.

Enjoy!
